I'm merging on the highway, driving fast
Gotta get where I'm going, got to make it past
All the other cars, gotta keep my flow
Gotta stay in my lane, gotta go with the flow

Chorus:
I merge, I merge
Gotta keep on moving, gotta make it work
I merge, I merge
Gotta stay in my lane, gotta do my part

Verse 2:
Merging can be tough, sometimes you gotta wait
But when it's your turn, you gotta accelerate
Gotta look ahead, gotta check your rear
Gotta make sure it's safe, before you steer

Chorus:
I merge, I merge
Gotta keep on moving, gotta make it work
I merge, I merge
Gotta stay in my lane, gotta do my part

Verse 3:
Merging is a skill, you gotta learn it right
Gotta be aware, gotta stay in sight
Of the other cars, gotta keep your distance
Gotta stay safe, gotta use persistence

Chorus:
I merge, I merge
Gotta keep on moving, gotta make it work
I merge, I merge
Gotta stay in my lane, gotta do my part
